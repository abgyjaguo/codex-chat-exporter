## 1. Implementation
- [ ] Define canonical Replay URL patterns (project/session/message anchor)
- [ ] Add minimal routes that can render a session transcript and resolve `#m-XXXXXX` anchors
- [ ] Add config `BRIDGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (or equivalent) to generate absolute replay links

## 2. Validation
- [ ] Add a small fixture session and verify anchors are stable and linkable

## 3. Documentation
- [ ] Document how export bundles and OpenNotebook publish generate `Open in Replay` links
