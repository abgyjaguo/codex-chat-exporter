## 1. Implementation
- [x] Add Bridge health check (`GET /bridge/v1/health`) before sync begins
- [x] Improve error messaging when Bridge is unreachable (actionable guidance)
- [x] After successful sync, show actions: “Open Replay” and “Copy Replay link”

## 2. Validation
- [ ] Manual test on Windows: bad base URL, Bridge down, Bridge up

## 3. Documentation
- [x] Update VSCode exporter docs/spec with the new UX behavior
